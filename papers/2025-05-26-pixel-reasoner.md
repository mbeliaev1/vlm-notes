Introduce pixel-space reasoning for VLMs, allowing "zoom-in" and "select-frame" actions during CoT. Instruction tuning followed by RL to train 7B VLM. Observe learning trap where model ignores visual operation, introduce constraints to the reward function to foster curiosity for pixel-space operations and penalize inefficient tool use. Synthetic self-correction trajectories added to the dataset.
