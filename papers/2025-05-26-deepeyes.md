Use RL only to train a 7B VLM that interleaves textual CoT with images, open-source. Utilizes a visual crop tool to select images and a conditional reward that only credits trajectories when tool use improves task success. Evolution of tool use shown in training: exploration, overuse, efficient exploitation. Impressive demo for a 7B model with no cold-start.
