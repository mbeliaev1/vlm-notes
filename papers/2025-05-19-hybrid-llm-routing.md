### TL;DR
Introduce a technique for training a router that filters "easy" queries and sends them to a  smaller (cheaper) LLM. The router is a binary classifier trained to minimize cross-entropy loss, where the labels are the expected "quality gaps" between the responses generated by each model. Experiments show that this approach generalizes at test time without end-to-end training, giving tangible cost savings at a performance drop of <1%.
