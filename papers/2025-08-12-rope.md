Introduces Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE), which is now the de-facto positional scheme for VLMs. Specifically, they propose using a distance-aware inner product that decays with separation. This is achieved without learning additional parameters, and instead relying on rotation matrices to inject the relative positions into the query and key vectors.
