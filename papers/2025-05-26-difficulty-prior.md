Case study with visual math reasoning: difficulty aware RL training can improve dataset efficiency and model performance. 1) Filter training data to remove "too easy" and "too hard". 2) Inject "difficulty-hint" to encourage deeper reasoning. 3) Re-weight GRPO's group advantages to amplify gradients for "hard" questions.
