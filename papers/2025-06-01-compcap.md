Introduce an automated pipeline that synthesizes captions for 6 types of "composite images", creating a dataset (118k), and using SFT to boost VLM performance at understanding charts, posters, screenshots, etc. While the performance gain is incremental (<3%), this work clearly tries to address the gap between understanding natural images and visual information that is present in computer use scenarios that are required for agentic tools.
