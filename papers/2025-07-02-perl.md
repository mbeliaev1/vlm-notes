In order to remove the positional bias exhibited during multi-image reasoning, PeRL permutes image order during GRPO while preserving semantics of the input. Additionally, they follow the common approach of filtering the dataset based on difficulty: using n=10 rollouts of Qwen-7B-Instruct for each sample, they compute the score and filter out half of the easy samples to shift the mean score from 0.78 to 0.38.
