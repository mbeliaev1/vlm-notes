Propose "Dynyamic Chunking", a new end-to-end framework that allows transformer models to learn their own byte-level tokenization, outperforming transformer baselines based on Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE). They use an H-Net architecture to implement a recursive encoder-decoder structure, enabling the model to learn hierarchical representation layers. Significant performance improvement on DNA, Chinese, and code, show the potential benefit in domains where standard tokenization is inferior.
