Couples Qwen-based VLM with diffusion decoder to create MindOmni for multimodal understanding and generation. Trains in three stages: 1) SFT with image-text pairs to ground the diffusion decoder. 2) SFT with CoT instruction data. 3) Reasoning generation policy optimization (RGPO). Introduce a consistency reward to GRPO for aligning the generated image and reference ground-truth prompt using cosine similarity.
