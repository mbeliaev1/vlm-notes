Analyzes R1-Zero training and introduces an unbiased GRPO algorithm, addressing response-level length bias , and question-level difficulty bias which both arise from the group advantage estimation in Vanilla GRPO. Provides thorough analysis comparing policy gradient methods, showing that by removing the two normalization terms contributing to bias in GRPO, they recover the original PPO objective, where advantage is estimated by Monte Carlo return with an unbiased baseline.
