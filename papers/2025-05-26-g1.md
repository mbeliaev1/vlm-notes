Open-source "VLM-Gym", a suite of vision games for benchmarking RL algorithms on VLMs. Add a perception reward as a verifiable signal (ground truth perception provided by game state), and show how a perception coldstart (SFT) bootstraps the symbolic reasoning abilities of VLMs, and proves training efficiency.
