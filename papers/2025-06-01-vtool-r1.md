Another "thinking with images" approach, where the toolset is limited to 2-D tensor operations (selecting rows/columns). Significant performance lift on ChartQA with RL, showing that tool competence generalizes to unseen chart types. Interesting that no inter-step (final outcome only) rewards were used compared to other recent visual reasoning works.
