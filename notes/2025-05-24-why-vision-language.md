In order for computational pattern-recognition systems to transform humanity, they must operate across multiple modalities. Specifically vision (images) and language (text). Comprehending text is essential for communication, while processing visual information is necessary for adaptation of agentic tools. Visual data is widely available and content rich, though arguably less sample efficient than our corpus of text. In short, vision-language models are the pathway to generalizable performance that can meaningfully move the needle on global productivity.
